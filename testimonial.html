            <p>I was privileged to work with Cameron on the development of the ground-breaking sign language
              interpretation feature for Forza Horizon 5, where his knowledge and guidance were essential to bringing
              our accessibility work to fruition. Cameron is one of those talented people who has a great deal of expert
              knowledge that he is able to effectively condense and communicate to listeners who lack his years of
              experience and context. His knowledge as both a British Sign Language user and a teacher of the deaf gives
              him invaluable perspective and insight when it comes to making accessible content.</p>
            <p>When we didn’t even know what questions we should be asking, Cameron was patient and thorough in walking
              us through how we might consider potential problems and solutions. Not only did he help us in the
              development of our sign language feature, but he also went above and beyond by giving us feedback on the
              accessibility of the rest of the game outside of that one feature.</p>
            <p>Cameron was also a valuable resource when it came to PR. He’s a natural presenter and helped us to better
              explain the feature to the larger community with his easy and charming interviewing style. Cameron was a
              pleasure to work with, and his contribution as an educator, accessibility consultant, and a presenter
              cannot be understated.</p>

            <p>Working with Cameron was an absolute pleasure. He speaks about accessibility within videogames with
              authority and passion and was able to inspire me and my team to do better and strive further.</p>
            <p>Cameron presents with a calm & clear tone, and he’s able to describe complex subjects in technical detail
              and also through real-world anecdotes which helped our team empathise with people from the deaf and hard
              of hearing community.</p>
            <p>Cameron is a videogame enthusiast who lives and works within the deaf and hard of hearing community, this
              lived experience allows him to work with a level of detail and nuance that added instant value to our
              project.</p>

            <p>The Xbox Global PR team had the privilege to work with Cameron following his consultation on the British
              Sign Language integration feature in Forza Horizon 5, the award-winning open-world racing game from Xbox
              Game Studios developer Playground Games. In addition to his impressive expertise in accessibility
              consultancy and advocacy for the deaf/hard of hearing, Cameron proved to be an incredible resource in
              telling this important story. Cameron was utilized as a spokesperson and participated in multiple press
              interviews – including written, phone, and full broadcast. He also spoke on camera in the Xbox YouTube
              feature, eloquently explaining the importance of integrating features like sign language into video games.
              Cameron’s teaching background, media and presentation skills, and commitment to championing inclusivity
              for others are why we can’t wait to work with him again soon.</p>
